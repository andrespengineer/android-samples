# Android-Samples

**Android-Samples** is a project to show different architectural approaches, SOLID Principles and clean code applied to exercises and new projections to develop Kotlin Android applications. In its different branches you will find different types of Android applications.  

Architectures: [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide?gclid=CjwKCAjw7--KBhAMEiwAxfpkWARBM3vubBOpHHvULyoTy68qjoheC-wESXngfHpfNe6P6Q45062M9RoCSaIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [MVP](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7026-getting-started-with-mvp-model-view-presenter-on-android) and [MVI](https://blog.mindorks.com/mvi-architecture-android-tutorial-for-beginners-step-by-step-guide).

  You will find practice projects that use the latest trends on Android, such as:

1. [Hilt for Android](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).
2. Kotlin [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) for background operations. 
3. [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) for RecyclerView. 
4. Reactive UI used by [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow), StateFlows and others.
5. [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/DiffUtil) and [AsyncListDiffer](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/AsyncListDiffer) for RecyclerView Adapters.
6. Schedule Tasks with [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager), [Workers](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker) and [CoroutineWorkers](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/coroutineworker).
7. Instrumentation tests and unit tests with [Hilt Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-testing).
8. Responsive UI Designs for different screen orientations.
9. New [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) Api.
10. [Lottie Animations](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) for Android.
11. [MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/motionlayout) transitions.
12. [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) | [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) Image Processing.
13. [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for Kotlin.
14. [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) and custom Fragments with [BottomNavigationView](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation).
15. [DayNight theme support](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) based on MaterialComponents.

# Project Samples

All samples are powered by [Postman Mock Servers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/).

**DISCLAIMER**: POSTMAN MOCK SERVER CAN LEAD TO UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR WHEN WORKING WITH **RECYCLERVIEWS** AND **FLOWS** SINCE THE OBJECTS ARE CREATED WITH DYNAMIC VALUES. EACH COLLECTION WILL BE PUBLISHED SO THAT IT CAN BE PERSONALIZED IN CASE YOU WANT TO SIMULATE FIXED DATA.
